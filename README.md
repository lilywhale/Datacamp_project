# Datacamp_project

## The Project 

We needed to create a chatbot for a company to handle simple customers querys.

We used streamlit to have a user friendly interface and keep things simple on the front-end part. 
You can see our app deployed on streamlit cloud with github on this link : https://lilywhale-datacamp-project-chatbot-streamlit-wm1rc3.streamlit.app/

We used a streamlit chat component to have a clean interface.
Our company sell clothing and accessories so you can ask our bot questions regarding : 
* payement methods
* problems with order
* bugs with our website
* problems with delivery
* the items we sell

So questions like "how does delivery take ?" or " I recieved the wrong color" 
The bot will answer you according to you question. 
You may have noticed that we implement a clear button, it's for you to clear the chat so that you don't have to scroll the chat for too long. When you feel that scrolling become annoying feel free to use it. 
As our bot don't take in consideartion past messages for his answer it wont affect the answers. 

We have 2 different dataset that you can see in this repository the one implemented in the app is the shortest of them but by far provide the best answers.
